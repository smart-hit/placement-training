<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    Amazon.com, Inc., doing business as Amazon, is an American multinational corporation and technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

    Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington.[6] The company initially was an online marketplace for books, but incrementally expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker "The Everything Store".[7]

    The company has multiple subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, providing cloud computing, Zoox, a self-driving car division, Kuiper Systems, a satellite Internet provider, and Amazon Lab126, a computer hardware R&D provider. Other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its market share and presence as a physical retailer.[8]
